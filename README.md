# Minimalist Collaborative Code Editor

This is a minimalist collaborative code editor built with Next.js, allowing multiple users to edit a single code file in real-time.

## Why Collaborative Code Editing?

Collaborative coding has become increasingly important in today's distributed work environments. Whether you're pair programming with a colleague, conducting a code review, or working remotely with a team, having the ability to edit code together in real-time can greatly enhance productivity and collaboration.

Traditional code editors lack built-in support for real-time collaboration, often requiring developers to resort to inefficient methods such as screen sharing or sending code snippets back and forth via chat or email. This project aims to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use solution for collaborative code editing, enabling developers to work together seamlessly regardless of their physical location.

## Features

- Real-time collaboration: Multiple users can connect to the same session and edit a shared code file simultaneously.
- Basic authentication: Users can join the collaborative session with a simple username/password authentication.
- Minimalist user interface: A simple and intuitive interface with essential components for code editing and real-time communication.
- Real-time updates: Changes made by one user are immediately reflected in the editor for all other users in the session.
- Simple chat feature: Users can communicate with each other via a real-time chat within the editor interface.
